# H1 HÖGBOMS FRISÖR - The Best Hair Salon in Sweden
### This is the official website for "Högboms Frisör - The Best Hair Salon in Sweden." This is the world-famous Scandinavian hair salon based in the small town of Norrtälje, just outside of Stockholm - a popular international tourist destination.
### This website is designed to be both useful, as well as inviting to potential clients of the hair salon, where they can easily find basic information such as prices for different cuts, opening hours, contact information and social media links, as well as book appointments.

## Bugs
### Resolved bugs
When testing my website, I discovered my attempt at enclosing an anchor tag in a button element caused an error. I fixed this, and the issue was resolved.

## Validator Testing
- HTML: After resolving my bug mentioned above, no errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator.
- CSS: Since a bootstrap template was used for the website, some warning messages were returned when passing through the official Jigsaw validator. However, I checked them, and all the "warnings" returned were intrinsic parts of the bootstrap template itself. So I concluded that the warnings had to do with the validatior encountering errors when processing the css of a bootstrap template.
- Accessibility: Ran Lighthouse in devtools to check Accessibility, and got an Accessibility score of 98.

# Deployment

# Credits
- A rough draft start of the code used for my final version of my project was written by my mentor, although based on what I had already written (which he was teaching me how to change in order to instead format it with an bootstrap template.) I credit my mentor Felipe Souza Alarcon for helping me write part of this code. I have cited within comments where it starts and ends from where I first entered it onto the page. I did frequent commits to show how it changed from there, and the additional pages were added.
- I decided to change strategy and delete my work, in favor of using a bootstrap template instead, to finish my website. This was a recommendation by my mentor, after a session where he showed me clearly his thinking behind this, which I quickly came into agreement with. My original efforts can still be seen in the git commit history.
- Credit also goes to the good people over at https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.0/css/bootstrap.css, for the original bootstrap template code used.
